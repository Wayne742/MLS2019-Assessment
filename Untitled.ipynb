    "The Boston Housing dataset contains information of house prices in various parts of Boston Massachusetts. The dataset was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. in their paper \"Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978\"(Delve 1996). The dataset was derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning house prices in the Boston area (Delve 1996).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is used extensively in Data Science and Machine Learning and was orginally part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Medium 2019). The dataset is typically used as a training set for algorithms used in predictive analytics. The goal is to predict the value of house prices using the given variables (Medium 2019). \n",

Could closeness to the Charles river be related to lower air polution thus making the area more desireable to live in thus pushing up the house price, if ths was the case could it be that being close to the Charles river meant that you were further away from large population centres and natually had a lower crime rate as a result of that. SO it's not closeness to the river that matters rather a distance form population centres.\n",

How does a description of the dataset inforn your thinking, decision making or influence further analyses? How do you decide what statistics will give you a meaningful insight or not as the case maybe! Does the nature of your decision or whatever influence your choice of statistics used to describe the dataset?"
