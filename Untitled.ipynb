    "\n",
    "EG. Could closeness to the Charles river be related to lower air polution thus making the area more desireable to live in thus pushing up the house price, if ths was the case could it be that being close to the Charles river meant that you were further away from large population centres and natually had a lower crime rate as a result of that. SO it's not closeness to the river that matters rather a distance form population centres.\n",

    "Ian has asked us to analyses the dataset from the perspective of the relationship between median house prices and being close to the Charles river. Is it fair to assume that house prices are the important metric for considereation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe there is a relationship between other variables that indirectly impact the price of houses or perhaps there is another factor that influences house prices and this is not measured at all in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "And another thing is what do the descriptive statisitics actually tell us about a dataset? How does a description of the dataset inforn your thinking, decision making or influence further analyses? How do you decide what statistics will give you a meaningful insight or not as the case maybe! Does the nature of your decision or whatever influence your choice of statistics used to describe the dataset?"
